# Import necessary modules
# Set parameters (number of trials, output file path)
# Open a log file to store results

# Define a function to perform one simulation iteration:
#   - Generate random numbers between 0 and 1
#   - Sum them until the sum is at least 1
#   - Count how many numbers were needed
#   - Return the count

# Define a function to run multiple simulations:
#   - Loop for the given number of trials
#   - Call the single simulation function
#   - Write each count to the log file
#   - Also store cumulative averages to observe the convergence

# Execute the function
# Close the log file
